This summer, we took the whole family on an incredible trip through Montana and Wyoming, soaking in the beauty of Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. From towering mountains to steaming geysers and peaceful lakes, it was a blast for all of us. Here’s how it went down!

##### June 4 - Gallatin Mountain Range
We kicked things off with some fun hikes in the Gallatin Mountain Range. The trek to Palisade Falls was a hit with its cool waterfall, and the hike to Grottos Falls had us all amazed by the funky rock shapes nature carved out.

##### June 5 - Yellowstone - North Entrance
Coming into Yellowstone through the North Entrance, we were wowed by the Petrified Tree and the awesome Tower Fall. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone blew us away, especially with the Lower and Upper Falls views from Inspiration Point and Artist Point. We spotted tons of wildlife in Hayden Valley, checked out the steamy Sulfur Cauldron, and got a kick out of the Mud Volcano. Yellowstone Lake was the perfect calm ending to our day.

##### June 6 - Yellowstone - North Entrance
Day two in Yellowstone had us exploring Mammoth Hot Springs with its cool terraced pools, listening to the hissing Roaring Mountain, and wandering through the colorful Norris Geyser Basin. While we missed a major eruption at Steamboat Geyser, we still had a blast exploring the colorful mud pots and hot springs at Artists Paintpot. The splashing cascade of Gibbon Falls was a perfect finale.

##### July 7 - Yellowstone - West Entrance
At the West Entrance, we couldn’t wait to see Old Faithful Geyser and the Upper Geyser Basin. Morning Glory Pool and Grand Prismatic Spring showed off nature’s best colors, and we enjoyed some tasty tacos at Lake House while watching the sunset. The West Thumb Geyser Basin, especially Abyss Pool at dusk, was stunning, and the Firehole Canyon Drive was a scenic treat. We wrapped up at Lake Village.

##### June 8 - Grand Teton
Switching to Grand Teton, we had a blast at Jackson Lake, perfect for our kayaking adventure, and Jenny Lake, where we took a scenic boat tour and paddled around. The hike to Inspiration Point gave us jaw-dropping views of Jenny Lake, the valley, and the Teton Range. The Jenny Lake Scenic Drive was a nice ride, and the Snake River let us spot some wildlife. The historic barns at Mormon Row were a big hit for family photos.

##### June 9 - Grand Teton
Our last day took us down Antelope Flats Road to Mormon Row again, followed by a hike to Taggart Lake. We caught a gorgeous sunrise at Schwabacher’s Landing with those amazing Teton reflections. Oxbow Bend gave us a perfect shot of Moran Mountain.

This family adventure through Yellowstone and Grand Teton was full of laughs, awe, and memories we’ll cherish forever. We’re already planning our next trip back!
