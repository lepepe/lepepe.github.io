After an incredible trip to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, I’ve been bitten by the camping bug! Car camping has become my favorite way to hit the road, set up a cozy base, and dive into the outdoors—whether it’s hiking, biking, or just soaking in the scenery. Unlike backpacking, car camping lets you pack a bit more to make your trip comfortable without sacrificing the adventure and kind of the only alternative when going with kids. In this post, I’m sharing my favorite camping gear for 2025.

##### Why Car Camping?
Car camping is all about convenience and comfort. You drive right up to your campsite, unload your gear, and create a home away from home. It’s perfect for weekend warriors. Whether you’re cooking a hearty meal, stargazing, or using your campsite as a base for day hikes, the right gear makes all the difference. Here’s what I’ve been using and loving lately, based on recent trips and some research.

##### Essential Car Camping Gear

1. Tent: [REI Co-op Campwell 4 Tent](https://www.rei.com/product/227863/rei-co-op-campwell-4-tent?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
A reliable tent is the heart of any car camping setup. It’s spacious enough for my family or four. It’s easy to set up, durable, and has excellent ventilation for warm summer nights. If you’re on a budget, the Coleman Skydome XL 8 is a solid, affordable option that’s sturdy and quick to pitch, though it has less premium mesh than the Campwell.
Why I Love it: The Campwell’s design keeps my campsite organized with gear loops and pockets.

2. Sleeping Pad: [REI Co-op Trailmade Self-Inflating Sleeping Pad](https://www.rei.com/product/220664/rei-co-op-trailmade-self-inflating-sleeping-pad?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
Sleeping comfortably is a must after a long day of hiking or biking. The REI Co-op Trailmade Self-Inflating Sleeping Pad is my go-to for its balance of comfort and portability. It inflates quickly and provides enough cushioning to keep me cozy on uneven ground. For solo campers or those on a budget, it’s a fantastic option that doesn’t skimp on quality.

3. Sleeping Bag: [REI Co-op Siesta Hooded 20 Double Sleeping Bag](https://www.rei.com/product/217591/rei-co-op-siesta-hooded-20-double-sleeping-bag?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
A good sleeping bag keeps you warm without overheating. The REI Co-op Siesta Hooded 20 Double Sleeping Bag is my pick for its warmth and roomy design, perfect for sharing or spreading out solo. It’s versatile for the unpredictable weather of places. On a budget? The REI Co-op Trailmade 20 Sleeping Bag is well-rated for its warmth and value.

4. Camp Kitchen: [Eureka Ignite Plus 2-Burner Camp Stove](https://www.rei.com/product/149914/eureka-ignite-plus-2-burner-camp-stove?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
Cooking outdoors is one of the joys of car camping, and the Ignite Plus 2-Burner Camp Stove by Eureka is my top choice. It’s powerful, easy to use, and perfect for whipping up gourmet campfire meals. Pair it with a Lodge 15-inch Cast Iron Skillet—I borrow mine from my home kitchen for everything from eggs to steak. For a budget option, the Coleman Classic Propane Stove is reliable and widely praised for its simplicity.

5. Cooler: [YETI Tundra 45 Cooler](https://www.yeti.com/coolers/hard-coolers/tundra/10045450011.html){:target="_blank"}
Keeping food fresh is critical for multi-day trips. The YETI Tundra 45 Cooler is my go-to—it’s durable, keeps ice for days, and is the perfect size for my Chevy Colorado’s bed.

6. Camp Chair: [REI Co-op Flexlite Camp Chair](https://www.rei.com/product/164382/rei-co-op-flexlite-camp-chair?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
Comfortable seating makes all the difference when you’re chilling by the fire. The REI Co-op Flexlite Camp Chair is my favorite for its lightweight design, portability, and comfort—perfect for my 5’1” frame. It packs down small and has a sturdy frame for uneven ground. For a premium option, the Helinox Beach Chair offers extra stability. Budget campers can use a cheap folding chair from home to start.

7. Lighting: [Black Diamond Astro 300 Headlamp](https://www.rei.com/product/202772/black-diamond-astro-300-headlamp?redirect-pup=false){:targte="_blank"} & [Coast EAL50R Rechargeable Lantern](https://www.rei.com/product/234130/coast-eal50r-rechargeable-lantern?redirect-pup=false){:target="_blank"}
Good lighting is crucial for safety and ambiance. The Coast EAL50R Rechargeable Lantern is my pick for its bright output, rechargeable battery, and warm glow option for cozy campsite vibes. I also rely on the Black Diamond Astro 300 Headlamp for hands-free tasks like setting up the tent at dusk.

8. Extras: Fun and Functional Add-Ons
- Chevy Colorado Trail Boss: My reliable ride for road trips, with enough bed space to haul all my gear.
- Ocean Kayak Malibu Two: Perfect for camping near water, this kayak is stable and great for exploring lakes and rivers.
- REI Co-op Trailgate Gear Bin: Keeps the gear organized in the truck bed, making it easy to grab what I need.
- Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Dry Bag and Ultra-Sil Stuff Sack: These keep gear and clothes dry and organized, especially for kayaking or rainy days.

##### Tips for Car Camping Success
Plan Your Packing: Space is still a factor, even in a pickup. Use collapsible gear like the HydraPak reservoir to maximize room. Stackable storage like the REI Trailgate Gear Cube keeps things tidy.
Leave No Trace: Pack out all waste, especially at dispersed sites. A lightweight trowel like the BoglerCo Ultralight Backpacking Trowel is great for digging cat holes if needed.
